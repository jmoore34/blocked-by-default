# Blocked by Default

## Objective
Blocked by Default is a Chrome extension that serves to reduce time spent on distracting sites. When the user navigates to a blocked site, a blockpage is presented, and after a challenge is completed, the user can unblock the page for an explicit duration.

When the unblock duration set by the user passes, the page becomes blocked again. Optionally, the user may set a lockdown duration during which the page is unable to be unlocked again.

## Installation
